# Install the skill into Muse (muse.ai), Meta's personal agent.
#
# Muse loads skills from ~/workspace/skills/<folder>/SKILL.md on its own
# computer. It reads a narrower frontmatter than Claude Code or Codex: the
# name must use underscores, and both values must be one-line quoted strings.
# This script copies the skill folder there and rewrites the frontmatter into
# that shape. The rest of the folder is copied unchanged.
#
# Run it inside Muse's computer (ask Muse to run the command in the README):
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaddrick/scripting-blender-scenes/main/scripts/install_muse.sh | bash
#
# Environment:
#   MUSE_SKILLS_DIR     where Muse reads skills (default: ~/workspace/skills)
#   MUSE_SKILL_SOURCE   a local skills/scripting-blender-scenes folder to
#                       install instead of downloading the latest release
#
# Run it again to update. It replaces the installed copy.
